        <h1>My European Love</h1>
        <h2>In Europe with my Family</h2>
        <p>My family and I went to Europe for a holiday before Chirstmas, 
        I was really excited because I have always wanted to go to Europe.
        The old Architecture, was one thing i wanted to see but seeing it in person made me love Europe even more
        It was such an interesting thing to see, all the wonders so well preserved.

            <div class="description">
                <p>The only problem was how cold it was, my parents and I were shivering all the time, only when 
                we were in a store were we free from the daunting coldness. Even though it was so cold, there was no snow,
                i was really sad to not see any because i have never seen snow before but always wanted to see it.
                I still want to thank my parents for taking me on this trip i hope i can pay them back one day.</p>
